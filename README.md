About
-----
This is a toy project. It was created for me to get familiar with the HTML5 canvas API and the Box2DWeb library.

Technologies used
-----------------

* *Box2DWeb* is a Javascript port of the famous Box2D physics engine. It enables the realistic simulation of the forces on the pendulum and the resulting motion.
* *EaselJS* "A Javascript library that makes working with the HTML5 Canvas element easy."
